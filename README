A very basic lambda calculus evaluator,

it evaluates alpha and beta reductions
and supports the following syntax
 Expression := identifier 
                | (\identifier. Expression)
                | Expression Expression

e.g. (\x. x) (\y. y) z
        ->  z

It's a fork of https://github.com/magic003/lambda_calculus_evaluator adapted for a course project (yes we're allowed to do  (yes we're allowed to do that)
